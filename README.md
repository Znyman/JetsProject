# JetsProject

## Description
This is a simple application which initializes some initial Jet objects in an Air Field, and you can interact with the jets in several ways.
There are 3 different types of jets:
1. Fighter Jets
2. Cargo Planes
3. Passenger Jets

Once starting the program, you can choose to:
- List the fleet and see the jets already initialized
- Make the jets fly
- Find the fastest jet
- Find the jet with the longest range
- Load all Cargo Planes
- Make the Fighter Jets dogfight
- Add a jet to the fleet and customize its attributes
- Remove a jet from the fleet by inputting its index

## Technologies Used
The program consists of several methods, each with various return types, various private attribute declarations with setters and getters, a `toString()` method, print statements, and a Scanner.

Other simple logic, data structures, and OOP concepts were included in the program such as:
- `abstraction`
- `encapsulation`
- `inheritance`
- `polymorphism`
- `interfaces`
- `if`
- `for each`
- `while`
- `switch`
- `ArrayList`
