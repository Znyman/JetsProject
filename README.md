There are 3 different types of jets, which are Fighter Jets, Cargo Planes, and Passenger Jets. Once starting the program, you can choose to list the fleet and see the jets already initialized; you can make the jets fly; you can find the fastest jet; you can find the jet with the longest range; you can load all Cargo Planes; you can make the Fighter Jets dogfight; you can add a jet to the fleet and customize its attributes; and you can remove a jet from the fleet by inputting its index.

Other simple logic, data structes, and OOP concepts were included in the program such as `if`, `for each`, `while`, `switch`, `ArrayList`, `interfaces`, `abstract class`, various private attribute declarations with setters and getters, a `toString()` method, print statements, and a Scanner.
